# Large-scale multiple linear regression using DSC

Numerical experiments for evaluating the performance of [Mr. Ash](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.ash.alpha) 
and other linear regression methods that are well suited for large-scale (possibly sparse) data sets. 
This is a reproduction, using [DSC](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview), 
of the [workflow](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr-ash-workflow) for the Mr.ASH manuscript by 
Kim, Wang, Carbonetto and Stephens (2020). See also [dsc-linreg](https://github.com/stephenslab/dsc-linreg).

The prediction errors of the different methods can be seen here: [Comparison of prediction errors](https://banskt.github.io/iridge-notes/2021/03/24/compare-prediction-accuracy-linear-regression-methods-dsc.html)
