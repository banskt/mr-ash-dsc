# Large-scale multiple linear regression using DSC

Numerical experiments for evaluating the performance of [Mr. Ash](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr.ash.alpha) and other linear regression methods that are well suited for large-scale (possibly sparse) data sets. This is a reproduction, using [DSC](https://stephenslab.github.io/dsc-wiki/overview), of the [workflow](https://github.com/stephenslab/mr-ash-workflow) for the manuscript by Kim, Wang, Carbonetto and Stephens.
